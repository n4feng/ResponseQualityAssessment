    "may i ask the risk to beta blockers?": [
        "Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, are medications commonly used to treat conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure), angina (chest pain), heart attack, and irregular heart rhythm",
        "However, these medications carry certain risks as well",
        "Some common side effects of beta blockers include fatigue, short-term memory loss, weight gain, reduced exercise ability, depression, unusual dreams, and even a feeling of lethargy",
        "In addition, they can cause a slow heartbeat and symptoms of asthma",
        "Beta blockers can also potentially mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetics, making it harder for them to realize when their blood sugar is dangerously low",
        "In some cases, abruptly stopping treatment with beta blockers can lead to a temporary worsening of heart symptoms like chest pain and heart attacks",
        "Therefore, if you need to stop taking a beta blocker, your doctor will gradually decrease your dose over weeks",
        "Beta blockers are used to treat conditions like hypertension, angina, heart attack, and irregular heart rhythms.",
        "If needing to stop beta blocker treatment, it should be done under the guidance of a doctor who will gradually reduce the dose."
